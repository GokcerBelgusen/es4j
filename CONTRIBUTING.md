Our goal is to encourage frictionless contributions to the project. In order to achieve that, we use ZeroMQ's [C4.1 process](C41.md) with some [pending] caveats. Please read it, it will answer a lot of questions. Our goal is to merge pull requests as quickly as possible and make new stable releases regularly.

At this moment, we don't have a formally defined code style guidelines, but ask to follow the general shape of the existing code and its conventions.
